**Project Name: Movie website**

Welcome to the Authentication Assignment project repository! This project is a demonstration of modern web development practices, utilizing Vite React as the build tool, Redux for state management, Redux Persist for local storage management, Tailwind CSS for styling, Zod for simple validation, and React Router DOM for navigation.

---

### Project Overview:

This project aims to showcase the implementation of authentication functionality in a React application. Users can sign up, log in, and view a protected dashboard page upon successful authentication.

### Features:

- **User Authentication:** Allows users to sign up and log in securely.
- **Protected Routes:** Implements protected routes to restrict access to certain pages for authenticated users only.
- **Persistent Data Storage:** Utilizes Redux Persist to store user authentication data securely in local storage, ensuring a seamless user experience across sessions.
- **Form Validation:** Employs Zod for simple and effective form validation to ensure data integrity.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilizes Tailwind CSS for responsive and visually appealing user interface design.

### Project Setup:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/authentication-assignment.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```
